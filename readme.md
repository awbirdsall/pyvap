# pyvap: simple model of particle evaporation

For a research project, I wrote a simple model of evaporation of components
from a multicomponent spherical particle. The model follows the treatment of
Maxwellian flux given in *Atmospheric Chemistry & Physics* by Seinfeld and
Pandis. The model is written in python 3, with scipy's ode solver.
